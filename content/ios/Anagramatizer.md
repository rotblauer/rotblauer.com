abstract = "A small, simple tool for creating and saving anagrams. Simply enter your to-be-anagrammed word or sentence of choice, and the hunt is on! As you create your new anagram, the letters you've used will disappear from the original and you'll know just what you've got left to use. And, not to fear! We've included a Shuffle option in case you've got anagrammer's block. Designed, built, and tested for anagrammers, by anagrammers. 'This app is not capable of a fraction of the genius of my Great Automatic Grammatizer.' - Roald Dahl 'One fish, two fish / Words are fun to squish.' - Dr. Seuss"
