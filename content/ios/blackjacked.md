abstract = "// The Deck: a wicked, awesome, and ultra-flexible WOD. // How does a deck-of-cards WOD work? --> Assign each suit in the deck to a single movement with optional modifications. The cards' rank determines repetitions. Then... Shuffle. Start flipping! Finish (whew!) Catch your breath. Drink a chocolate milkshake. Rinse. Wash. Repeat. // About Black Jacked --> The app is designed to be as simple and as flexible as possible, so that you can easily build, use, and track great WODS with it - without being hassled by ads, the internet, or bugs. // What's in the box --> The app comes with some built-in libraries designed by a certified CrossFit coach which you can add to, modify, or replace, as you see fit (get it?!) - including: - 17 handbuilt (and battle tested!) deck WODS - 33 movements (pull ups, sit ups, push ups... ) - 14 mods (body armor, strict, weighted... ) // What's not in the box --> The internet. Your WOD and log data is stored locally, and only available to you, which saves on battery and keeps things simple. But be advised: if you delete the app, your data will go along with it! // Built by crazy people for crazy people --> Built, tested, and used by a CrossFit coach and her uncertified but equally nuts twin brother. // We love feedback --> Wish the app could do something it can't yet? Send us an email at rotblauer@gmail.com and we'll be in touch about incorporating your suggestions in the next update."
