abstract = "Spoop iOS is an application for Open Biome donors to track their poos and poo donations. It connects securely with the web-based Spoop app+API (http://spoop.info) to integrate donor-generated logs across web and mobile platforms. With Spoop, donors are able to track time of passage, weight, bristol score, donation status, and to use custom qualitative #tags and notes in an effort to contextualize and make sense of their own rhythms, habits, and biofeedback over time."
